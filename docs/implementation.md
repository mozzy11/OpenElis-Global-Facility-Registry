# OpenELIS Global - Implementation Notes

## Assessments
The initial assessment is an **IMPORTANT** step in the preparation of the implementation of IT solutions, particularly in the area of HIS which concerns us.
It is good to have an idea of the existing in terms of infrastructure, process, organization, existing documents, existing software ...
This study encompasses several aspects of the activity within the laboratory and should provide an idea of the following aspects:

* *Site Overview*

	a short Description of the laboratory activity

* *Workflows*

If possible, Attach: 
	1. A map of the physical layout of the lab
	2. A description of the physical sample processing workflow
	3. Any sample forms used in the workflow
	4. A description of the QA/QC workflows
	5. The Integration Workflow

* *External Electronic Systems Interoperability*

Collect any infprmations concerning existing data software used on the laboratory for potential system interoprability.


* *Infrastructure Needs*

Short description of current and our proposed power failure backup plan, stability of current power, etc.
current internet and intranet network; 
	1. Power Supply
	2. Internet Network
	3. Intranet Network
	4. Equipment Needs and Placement
	5. Workforce Capacity (composition, knowledge, skills, attitudes)


## Equipments needs
we are working on the deployment of an application using network configuration. 
The main application is installed on a computer (server). 
several client workstations will be able to access to this server via a network to be configured

* *server minimal configuration*

	`Processor:	Core i3`;
		
	`RAM:	4 Go`;
	
	`Hard Disk:	500 Go`;
		
	`External Hard Disk:	500 Go`;
	
	`Ethernet Output available or provide wifi key`;
	
	`UPS: 1000 /1500 VA`;

* *workstation minimal configuration*
	
	`Processor:	Dual core`;
	
	`RAM:	4 Go`;
	
	`Hard Disk:	500 Go`;
	
	`External Hard Disk:	500 Go`;
	
	`Ethernet Output available or provide wifi key`;
	
	`UPS: 650 VA`;
	
	
* *Network Configuration*
	
	`Wifi Router`;
	
	`Provide wifi key or ethernt cable`;
