# Upgrading OpenELIS 2.x 

## Special 2.0 to 2.3 Instructions

If you have an OpenELIS Global 2.2 or earlier (but not 1.x) you will need to create a client facing keystore. The easiest way to do this is to simple copy the keystore. 

`cp /etc/openelis-global/keystore /etc/openelis-global/client_facing_keystore`

After this, you can upgrade as normal. 

##Upgrades

OpenELIS Global uses an "upgrade in place" mechanism that saves all the already entered data, as well as custom tests, system settings, etc. 

The default action of the installer is to install/upgrade. If the installer can find an existing version of OpenELIS, it runs the upgrade, if not, it installs. 

So, to upgrade, one must download the new installer, EG for the RC of OpenELIS 2.3

`curl -L -O https://www.dropbox.com/s/h2t20m6kzfj519y/OpenELIS-Global_2.3.2.5_Installer.tar.gz`

Then unpack the file

`tar -xvf OpenELIS-Global_2.3.2.5_Installer.tar.gz`

and finally, run the isntaller to upgrade

`sudo python2 setup_OpenELIS.py`
